Disclaimer 1: The app is built using class-based components without hooks. As I'm a big fan of hooks and functional components and use them in all my other apps, I reserved the right to have one app with good old classes.



Disclaimer 2: Redux is a total overkill for a small-scale app like this lol. However, as I wanted to have some practice, I implemented it here along with Redux-Thunk. 

A moodboard web application tailored to user preferences. Built on React using 2 APIs and react-sound
